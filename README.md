I am taking this course to build a strong foundation in both web development and software development, with the goal of becoming a well-rounded developer. 
I have chosen Python as my primary programming language because of its simplicity, versatility, and strong community support. 
Python is widely used in web development, automation, data analysis, and artificial intelligence, making it an ideal language for gaining practical and in-demand skills. 
I intend to use Python not only to strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts but also to explore web frameworks like Django or Flask,
which will allow me to build dynamic, full-featured websites and continue advancing my software development capabilities.

Through this assignment 2, I learned how to structure a Python program using object-oriented programming by creating a separate BMICalculator class to handle logic and classification. This helped me understand the value of modular design, clean code, and reusability. I also practiced using constants, naming conventions, formatting output, and referencing WHO standards. Overall, it strengthened my skills in handling input, control flow, and building scalable applications skills I plan to apply in future projects
