I am taking this course to build a strong foundation in both web development and software development, with the goal of becoming a well-rounded developer. 
I have chosen Python as my primary programming language because of its simplicity, versatility, and strong community support. 
Python is widely used in web development, automation, data analysis, and artificial intelligence, making it an ideal language for gaining practical and in-demand skills. 
I intend to use Python not only to strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts but also to explore web frameworks like Django or Flask,
which will allow me to build dynamic, full-featured websites and continue advancing my software development capabilities.

Through this assignment 2, I learned how to structure a Python program using object-oriented programming by creating a separate BMICalculator class to handle logic and classification. This helped me understand the value of modular design, clean code, and reusability. I also practiced using constants, naming conventions, formatting output, and referencing WHO standards. Overall, it strengthened my skills in handling input, control flow, and building scalable applications skills I plan to apply in future projects

In this assignment 3, I built a BMI calculator using class properties and the @property decorator to compute values like weight in kilograms, height in meters, BMI, and its category. This approach allowed me to access calculations as attributes, making the code cleaner, more readable, and more Pythonic. Compared to using separate methods, properties helped me better understand encapsulation and how to simplify object-oriented programming by hiding internal logic while offering a clear interface to users

In Assignment 4, I learned how to validate user input and method parameters to ensure only valid data is accepted. By checking data types and value ranges, and raising exceptions when invalid inputs occur, I made the BMI calculator more robust and reliable. Using @property decorators helped me keep the code clean and encapsulated, resulting in a simple yet powerful program that handles errors gracefully.

In Assignment 5, I learned how to use the unittest framework to create automated tests for the BMICalculator class. I tested both metric and imperial inputs, property setters, conversions, and BMI category classifications. I also used coverage.py to ensure 100% test coverage. This assignment helped me understand how to write reliable tests and verify that my code works as expected.

In Assignment 6, I learned how to use Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams to design an object-oriented program based on a hierarchy of employees, including managers (salary), salespeople (commission), and hourly employees. I implemented inheritance by creating a base Employee class and extending it in specialized subclasses, each overriding the calculatePay method. The UML diagram helped me visualize class relationships before coding. I also documented my code using Python docstrings and wrote unit tests with the unittest module to automatically verify the functionality of each class.

In Assignment 7, I learned that polymorphism allows different classes to define their own versions of a method, such as calculatePay(), while sharing the same interface through a common base class. By storing different types of employees Manager, SalesPerson, and HourlyEmployee in a list of Employee references, I was able to call the calculatePay() method on each object without knowing its specific type. This showed me how polymorphism enables flexible and dynamic method execution based on the actual object type at runtime, making code more modular and easier to extend.

In Assignment 8, I learned how to create a simple text editor using Python's Tkinter library by applying object-oriented programming principles. I built a GUI window that includes a multi line text area with both vertical and horizontal scrollbars, allowing users to write and navigate text easily. I also learned how to structure widgets using frames and configure scrollbars to work with the text widget. This foundational project has given me a solid start in GUI development with Tkinter.

In Assignment 9, I learned how to improve a basic text editor application using the Tkinter library in Python. I added a menu bar with two main menus: "File" and "Edit." The File menu includes options like "New" to clear the text area and "Exit" to close the application, while the Edit menu provides important functions such as Cut, Copy, and Paste. I also created a context menu that appears on right-click, offering the same editing options for quick access. Additionally, I integrated vertical and horizontal scrollbars to make navigating through larger text easier. This assignment helped me better understand how to create menus, bind events, and organize layouts in a graphical user interface, enhancing both the functionality and usability of the application.

In Assignment 10, I learned how to enhance a basic text editor by adding new features such as Open, Save, and Save As options to the File menu using standard dialog boxes from the filedialog module. I practiced how to open, read, and write text files in Python, as well as how to keep track of the currently opened file using a variable like self.current_file. I also learned how to create a Format menu that allows users to customize text by changing the font and color. For font selection, I used the tkinter.font module along with a popup window where users can choose a font family and size, and for color selection, I implemented the colorchooser.askcolor() dialog to pick text colors. Through this project, I gained valuable experience working with various Tkinter widgets, menus, and dialog boxes, and learned how to structure GUI applications using classes and methods to improve organization, functionality, and interactivity
